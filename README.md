# Action-rules-with-LERS

## Extraction of Classification rules using LERS:

• The software required for the project was installed.
• The java code was run to obtain the classification rules using the LERS algorithm.
• The program returns the certain, possible and marked values after executing the LERS algorithm.

## Reclassification of rules:

• ARAS generates all the classification rules using the LERS strategy.
• Clusters are built around the objects that are to be reclassified by the user by considering a decision attribute from the rules.

A Graphical user interface has been developed to ease the process of accepting input, producing the outputs, setting the support, confidence, initial, end values 
and selecting the decision attribute using Java.
